20240910 while updating to neovim 0.10.1
- through chocolatey, for some reason, new nvim told me RUNTIME contained old stuff.
  i might have removed it manually before uninstalling/reinstalling neovim but somehow,
  choco would never generate runtime files anymore (despite them being in its zip file).
- ended up downloading msi file from neovim website to manually install it.

meh.

Also installed choco install gh for gh cli auth.

Not quite sure to follow the hererocks/luarocks stuff for lazy but I don't need it yet so whatever.

Very cool stuff found on @thingskatedid (twitter)
; some command | idot
idot : alias to graphviz dot, outputs SVG, converted to PNG by rsvg-convert, then rendered IN terminal.
why an alias : to specify fonts/colours to match terminal settings.

; seq 1 5 | ./line.awk | isvg
line.awk generates SVG
isvg : alias rsvg-convert | icat
icat : alias <terminal image rendering + options>

That's seriously insanely cool.

Other great thing : prompt colour changes with command return code.

https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/ou4vht/resolving_merge_conflict_when_merging_changes/
VERY IMPORTANT help to resolve merge conflicts when syncing fork with kickstart.

There are multiple types of merge conflicts like, competing line merge conflict, which arises when you and a user(committer to the same source repository) changes the same line, the second type is the same thing with files or folders.

1. NOW if you have competing line merge conflicts, then:
Check if you have the 'upstream' remote set: type this in the terminal of that repository: git remote this should display the remotes set in your repository, probably origin and upstream.

ALSO READ the Important section below

2. Type: git pull upstream <branch name> (probably <branch name> is main).

3. Then go to your local system file where you've cloned your forked repository, look for conflict markers: <<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>. Remove these, and do the changes you want to resolve the conflict.

2. NOW if you are facing Removed file merge conflict then:
Repeat steps 1 and 2 of heading 1

ALSO READ the Important section below

2. Go to the cloned repository and delete or change the file OR folder, according to the requirement.

NOTE: Remember that while performing these STEPS you are in your cloned repository, and not in a subfolder(of the repo) in the terminal.

Important: If you see only origin as the remote in step 1 of the heading 1, then add the upstream remote in your git repository; Just type this in the terminal: git remote add upstream <link of the source repository>. This step needs to be done inside the forked repository in the terminal.

Thanks for Reading happy Coding!

another note : new kickstart version apparently "breaks" the starting screen.
restoring previous version makes it work again.
=> gotta look at the differences and read the whole thing to try and understand what's up.

other issue I've ran into again when restoring previous version :
Mason's checkhealth error.
The only info I've found is to delete nvim's cache (AppData/Local/Temp/nvim).
Seems to fix it but seems somehow random ?

Weird stuff. Switched from gcc to clang for treesitter and Mason's checkhealth started working again. Uh...

also, I noticed :Lazy does not display its entire menu correctly unless I press a key.
I'm having this issue with both versions of kickstart.

very important note :
require 'nvim-treesitter.install'.compilers = { "clang", "gcc" }
mandatory at home to avoid Windows Defender flagging gcc compiled objects as infected.
clang is the way apparently.

weird, I thought I had edited this to add packages installed with choco at work.
forgot to push ?

Anyway, by now I must have bookmarked the nvim treesitter github page with its fix for
windows defender finding viruses in parsers : simply force clang as the compiler instead of gcc.
My init.lua here is doing it and everything's back to normal.
Also, clang means installing LLVM (through choco :)

if needed, use chocolatey to install things.

note : I removed my manual copy of mingw and installed it with choco !
note : it seems git comes with a version of GNU core utils (unzip and what not).
Check c:\program files\git\usr\bin.

so perhaps that might help completing nvim's checkhealth warnings.

most the the prereqs are listed by checkhealth so the're's not a looot to say here but I must
keep track of what I do on both computers.

it should, in the end, lay out somewhat of a setup guide for neovim and python.

pip install 'pynvim @ git+https://github.com/neovim/pynvim' for python 3.12 until version is officially released.
january 11: pynvim current release does not work with python 3.12

@home, not using choco anymore, stand alone or scoop :
